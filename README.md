# linear-Regression-model
Linear regression is a supervised machine-learning algorithm that 
predicts a continuous value based on a set of independent variables.
The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that 
minimizes the error between the predicted values and the actual values.

Here are some of the advantages of using linear regression:

- It is a simple algorithm that is easy to understand and implement.
- It is a versatile algorithm that can be used to predict a wide variety of continuous values.
- It is a relatively efficient algorithm that can be trained quickly.
